### Hi there, I'm Ali Mustain! 👋

I'm a 7th-semester Physics student passionate about bridging the gap between **Science** and **Technology**. I love building IoT devices, simulating physical systems, and currently exploring artificial intelligence.

- 💡 I turn physics concepts into code (and sometimes games!).
- 🎨 I also enjoy graphic design & handicrafts (Check out [Inn Creaft]!).

**🛠 Tech Stack:**
* **Languages:** Python & C++
* **Hardware/IoT:** Arduino, ESP32, and Sensors
* **Simulation:** Python, Double Pendulum Systems
